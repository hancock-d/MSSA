2.2a Class hierarchy

Design a class hierarchy of your choice. (Need only class files)
Pet (Parent) New class, base
	Dog (Derived 1) New class, inherit pet
		Hound (Derived 1.a) New class, inherit dog
			Beagle (Derived 1.a.a) 
		Terrier
			Welsh Terrier
		Working
			Boxers

Don't need to use main method
Don't use dog/pet, create own hierarchy

Furniture--Base class -- has legs, material, location
	chair--new class, inherit Furniture --add nothing
	table--new class, inherit Furniture --add surface, decorations
		desk--new class, inherit Table  --add surface, decorations, drawers

	couch--new class, inherit Furniture --has cushions
