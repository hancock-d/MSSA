Expected Output :
Roll No : 784
Name of Student : James
Marks in Physics : 70
Marks in Chemistry : 80
Marks in Computer Application : 90
Total Marks = 240
Percentage = 80.00
Division = First


roll number = Id
marks for 3 subjects
total marks = scores of all 3 subjects combined
percentage = average of 3 scores
division = grade received
