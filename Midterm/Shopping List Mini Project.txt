Hey MAtt! Left the capital A typo so I'd look less like a bot :)
I'm a transitioning service member at JBLM, WA (near Seattle), saw your profile and thought I'd reach out! Currently going through Microsoft's MSSA program (MSFT Software and Systems Academy) and will be in the job market soon!

Fellow MSSA student, CAD! Glad to find fellow strugglers!
