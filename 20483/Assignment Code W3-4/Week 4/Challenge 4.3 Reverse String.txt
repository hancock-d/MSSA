4.3 Challenge Reverse String

3. Write a function that reverses a string.
The input string is given as an array of characters s.
You must do this by modifying the input array in-place. (Problem 344 in leetcode)

Example 1:
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2:
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

use pointers (left, right)--variables that store memory addresses, they "point" to a location in memory
	Left starts at index 0
	right starts at s.length-1
No in-built functions
No extra array
Can go char by char and change positions
Basically doing a swap

Foreach loop?--No, foreach is for reading values, not modifying them
Need a for loop or while loop (while preferred, easier to read/clearer)
