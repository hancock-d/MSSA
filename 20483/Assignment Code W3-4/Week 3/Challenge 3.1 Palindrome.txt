Challenge 3.1 Palindrome

1. Given a string, write a method that checks if it is a palindrome (is read the same backward as forward). Assume that string may consist only of lower-case letters.

Expected input and output

IsPalindrome("eye") → true
IsPalindrome("home") → false

-Don't use in-built functions (like reverse)
-do a for loop to check if first/last letter are the same, 2nd/2nd to last, etc...
-use pointers (implementing and decrementing)
