Group challenge LeetCode 128

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence
Algorithm must run in O(n) time

Intput: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: the longest consecutive elements sequence is [1,2,3,4]. Therefore its length is 4

Example 2:
Inputs: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,6,4,0,1]
Output: 9

Sorting--too high of time complexity
