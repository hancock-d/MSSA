10.1 (De)Serialize Object XML, JSON

Create any user defined class of your choice like Student, Customer etc.
Add 3 properties in it (of your choice).
Serialize and deserialize the a list of the objects of this class by XML, JSON format.


Create a class: Student
3 Properties: Name, Age, ID { get; set; }

Instead of single object serialization, do a list
List of students and completely serialize the list
You can create the list using dummy data/hard-coded
When you read them back, you have to get the list back

Serialize: Convert an object into a format that can be saved to a file or transmitted (send data over a network)
Deserialize: Reconstruct the object from the serialized format--allows you to retrieve the object's data after saving it
