6.2b Array Product

2. Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
-answer[i] tells you you're returning a new array (answer[i])
-nums[i] and answer[i] are separate arrays 

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.
Doesn't ask you to keep in place, you can declare another array

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

can use a while loop
