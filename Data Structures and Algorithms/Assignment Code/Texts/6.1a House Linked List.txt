6.1a House Linked List

1. Implement a single linked list with each node representing a house.
You may add data in it like house number, brief address, type of house ( like Ranch, Colonial). 
Each house (node) will be linked to next.
Give facility to the user to search a house by its number and then display the details. ( Windows Form or Console)


Each house node will require these 3 values

    class Node
    {
public in HouseId {get; set; }
public string Address {get; set; }
public string Type {get; set; }
        public int data;// data 
        public Node next;// address of next node / ref/ link to next 
        public Node(int val,Node next)
        {
            this.data = val;
            this.next = next;
        }


any node when created for the first time will be null

Use the struct to assign house-node (?)

can just use addfirst or addlast
