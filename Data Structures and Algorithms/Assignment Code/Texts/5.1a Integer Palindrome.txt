5.1a Integer Palindrome

1. Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

Example 2:
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Do not convert to string, no in-built functions (like reverse)
Must check it digit-wise, each individual digit
May also consider negative numbers

====================

Negative numbers can never be palindromes--return false immediately if x<0
