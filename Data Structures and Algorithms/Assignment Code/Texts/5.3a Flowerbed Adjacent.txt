5.3a Flowerbed Adjacent

1. You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1 
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false

Make it as linear as possible, no n^2 (no nested for loops)
Conditions to consider when going through the for loop

Determine whether n flowers can be planted in a given flowerbed (represented as array of 1s and 0s)
Approach should be linear (O(n))==no nested loops
A flower (1) cannot be next to another flower (1)
If adjacent plots are empty (0) or out of bounds, can plant
