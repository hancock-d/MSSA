7.3 Binary Search Tree

You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer val.

Find the node in the BST that the node's value equals val and return the subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return null.

Function you'll be writing to do the search
Getting root and integer value
Find the node in the BST so that node's value == value you're trying to find
return subtree rooted in that node; the node reference; the temp
don't just return a Boolean value, return the node reference if found
return null if not found
